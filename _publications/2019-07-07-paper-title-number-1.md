Maddah-Ali and Niesen, in a seminal paper, introduced the notion of coded caching. The exact nature of the fundamental limits in this context has remained elusive even as several approximate characterizations have been found. A new optimal scheme for the <i>(3, 3)</i> cache network, operating at the memory rate pair <i>(5/3, 1/2)</i> for the demand where all the users request for distinct files, was introduced recently to partially address this issue. In this paper, an extension of this scheme to the general <i>(K, K)</i> cache network, operating at the memory rate pair <i>(K-1-<sup>1</sup> &frasl;<sub>K</sub>, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>(K -1)</sub></i>, is proposed. A new lower bound is also derived which demonstrates the optimality of the proposed scheme for the demand where all the users request for distinct files.
